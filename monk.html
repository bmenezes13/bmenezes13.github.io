                <h5 id="intro" class="cart-title">Introduction</h5>
                <p class="card-text">Monks are a great class for starting out, they keep things pretty simple while still having a few unique abilities. Monks are predominately martial artists, fighting with fists and staves, but because of their expertise in weaponless fighting, they can do just as much damage as a sword, sometimes more. They also don't wear armor, almost guaranteeing a nimble character for your party, as some armors can cause disadvantage on Dexterity based checks</p>
                <h5 id="ki" class="cart-title">Ki Points</h5>
                <p class="card-text">A exclusive feature for this class, Ki Points can be used to use special class abilities during combat: </p>
                <ul>
                  <li> Flurry of Blows costs 1 Ki point and allows you to take 2 additional attacks as a bonus action instead of just 1, letting you do some extra damage.</li>
                  <li>Step of the Wind also costs 1 ki point and allows you to take the Dash or Disengage action as a bonus action on your turn, letting you get away, or perhaps closer to a certain enemy.</li>
                </ul>
                <h5 id="role" class="cart-title">Role</h5>
                <p class="card-text">Monks typically play a very unique role in the world, so talk to your Dungeon Master about what sort of people a monk might be and what their monastic order stands for. Monks in dnd are typically stoic and wise, but if you want to play a punch-throwing party animal, that’s up to you. 
                When creating your character’s personality think about their relationship with the monastery, the rest of the monks, and their duties there. Were they a begrudging member of the order, or did they join out of a deep passion for that they did? Do they consider the monastery their family or are they glad to get away? 
                Monks are a great member of a party as well. In combat, they are highly mobile, and can move very quickly to get up to enemies and do high amounts of damage. Depending on your build and subclass choice, monks can be considered to be either a DPS or Support class, and are most useful in melee range of an opponent alongside a Tank character. </p>
                <h5 id="stat">Choosing Stats, Race and Skills</h5>
                <p class="card-text">When creating stats for your monk, your highest skill should be dexterity, followed by your wisdom. Your high dexterity allows you to be effective and agile in combat while your wisdom makes the effects of your Ki abilities stronger. 
                Races that give a boost to your Dexterity or your Wisdom will be best, so think about playing an elf, halfling or a human to give you the best combination of stat increases.
                When picking out which skills you want to be proficient in (refer to the list on the right), think about what playstyle you want to use for the character. If you wanna be sneaky and agile while taking advantage of wearing no armor, your best options would be Acrobatics and Stealth. Religion and History, however, can prove to be useful skills for investigative purposes.</p>
                <h5 id="sub" class="cart-title">Subclass</h5>
                <p class="card-text">When you reach your 3rd level in Monk, you'll pick up a subclass, which is a specific specialization applied for your specific playstyle. The Way of Mercy, for example, would make your monk character more support focused, while Way of the Astral Self would allow you to have more abilities within combat.</p>
