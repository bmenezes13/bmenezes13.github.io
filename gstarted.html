                <h5 id="dnd" class="cart-title">What is D&D?</h5>
                <p class="card-text">In the simplest of terms, D&D, or Dungeons and Dragons is a tabletop RPG (role-playing game), and it's known as the first fantasy role-playing game in history, having been created by Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson in 1974. In a mostly story-driven adventure, players assume the roles of fictional characters exploring an entire fantasy world full of dungeons, monsters, and of course, dragons, as they are presented by a Dungeon Master (DM).</p>
                <h5 id="as" class="cart-title">Ability Scores</h5>
                <p class="card-text">When looking at a character sheet, you'll find six very prominent key words: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. You'll also be hearing these words come up a lot during game sessions, whether it's when you or a party member are performing an action, or when the dungeon master needs everyone to check for something. Each of these abilities have a number in range from 1 to 20, which measures the magnitude of that ability. </p>
                <h6 id="acm" class="card-subtitle">Ability Checks and Modifiers</h6>
                <p class="card-text">During a game session, your DM may ask you to perform an ability check, naming one of the six to use. When that happens you'll need to keep in mind your modifier for that ability. A modifier is measured from -5 to +30, and is determined by subtracting 10 from the ability score, then dividing by 2 (rounded down). For example, an ability score of 14 would have a modifier of +2, while a score of 2 would have a modifier of -4. When an ability check is performed, a player will roll a d20 (20-sided die) and add their ability's modifier to the roll, determining your chance of success. This will be contested with a difficulty class (DC) preset by the DM before the check is called for.</p>
                <h6 id="addis" class="card-subtitle">Advantage and Disadvantage</h6>
                <p class="card-text">Sometimes you'll be asked to make a check with advantage or disadvantage. When this happens, you'll roll the d20 twice instead of once, taking the higher of the two rolls when using advantage, and lower when using disadvantage. This can be caused by a spell effect, a class ability, or even for role-playing reasons within the story of the game</p>
                <h6 id="skp" class="card-subtitle">Skills, Saving Throws, and Proficiency Bonus</h6>
                <p class="card-text">Each of the six abilities cover a wide range of skills, which are usually measured with the same modifiers as their 'parent' ability. There will also be cases in which you'll be marked as proficient in one or more of these skills and will be given a proficiency bonus from +2 to +6, depending on your character level, which can be added to the check you make for that skill. These bonuses can also be added to saving throws, which are rolls made against certain threats in-game. These threats can come from traps, spells, poison, etc. When choosing your class, you'll be given proficiency in saving throws for two different abilities relating to your character.</p>
                <h5 id="rcs" class="cart-title">Races</h5>
                <p class="card-text">When creating your character, the two main aspects you'll want to look at first are your race and class. Race refers to the species your character is, which can vary from the natural human being to a more obscure creature such as a dragonborn. The race you choose will give you some character features at the start of the game, such as a bonus to an ability score, your base speed of movement, or even how far you can see in the dark.
                Classes, on the other hand, is what provides you with your proficiency bounuses, as well as a vast array of features and traits you'll find yourself using during explorations, combat, and role-playing. Each class can also serve one of three curcial roles in your party: tank, dps, and support.</p>
                <h5 id="pill">The 3 Pillars of D&D</h5>
                <h6 id="exp" class="card-subtitle">Exploration</h6>
                <p class="card-text">During your adventures you and your party will encounter many exotic locales like ancient temples, underground dwarven citadels, or even The Nine Hells (which is exactly what it sounds like). To survive these largely unexplored and dangerous areas you’ll have to work together as a team and keep an eye out for traps and hidden enemies. When you go to a new area the DM will describe, generally, what the terrain around you looks like. That description is just what your character sees upon first glance entering the area, but the DM can and will provide more details about certain parts of the environment that may not be what they seem. Often when you ask questions about the environment the DM will have you roll one of two Skill Checks to gain new information: Investigation if you should use your Intelligence ability, or Perception if Wisdom is preferred.
                If you wanted to search the papers on the desk for useful information or find a particular type of book the DM will have you roll an Investigation Check. If you want to see an invisible object or make sure no one is hiding behind the armchair, you will be asked to make a Perception Check. You should always make sure to specify what you’re searching for as well. If you don’t know what information in those papers you’re looking for, the DM won’t know what to highlight for you and you won’t get what you’re looking for.
                Other times you will also be exploring more wild areas such as jungles, caves, deserts, or the open sea. In these instances, you and your team will need to navigate, which will likely take the form of Survival Checks. Survival, linked to your Wisdom score, is your character’s ability to track prey, navigate, start a fire, or cook rations. Basically, anything you would think of as a Boy Scout skill would fall under Survival.</p>
                <h6 id="com" class="card-subtitle">Combat</h6>
                <p class="card-text">Combat is, in many ways, the part of the game that involve the least amount of role-play. When a situation becomes hostile, the DM will ask you to “roll for initiative.” This is a special type of dexterity roll that determines the order players take during combat. Once everyone rolls, whoever rolled the highest initiative will go first, then the second highest, etc. It is important to realize, however, this is just a practicality. In the narrative of the game, each players turn takes place at approximately the same time, and only for around six seconds. This means while combat can take hours for the players, it only takes minutes or even seconds for the characters. On a players turn, they are able to move an amount depending on their race and class, and are also able to use one action, which represents one task the player can do (attack with a weapon, cast a spell, dash away, look around, etc.) Most of a players actions are based on their class, unlocking more powerful abilities as they level up, although some classes give players unique actions they can take during their turn.
                Combat is the most tactical part of the game, with many DMs choosing to draw out a physical map for the players to fight on, and many players will spend hours of the game preparing for specific important combat encounters. Some players will even organize games that only feature combat, where players fight each other to see who can design the best fighter and plan the best tactics based on the rules of the game. Overall, combat is very different to the rest of the game, but it is still very important. Worlds in Dungeons and Dragons are inherently hostile, and many powerful people are out only for themselves.</p>
                <h6 id="rp" class="card-subtitle">Role-playing</h6>
                <p class="card-text">To further the experience and to gain additional information in your adventure, you may need to talk to additional characters who inhabit the world. Non-Player Characters (NPCs) are people outside of your main adventuring party and are usually played by the DM. This is where role-play comes into effect. Role-play is an important part of any DnD experience, as it allows the world to feel more tangible and allows an alternate route to finding information, and sometimes, even avoiding unnecessary combat. This is when you, the player, get to really step into the shoes, or adventuring boots, of your character. This can seem daunting, especially for first time players, but fear not! You will be doing it naturally in no time. One way to make roleplay much easier is to settle, in advance, who your character is. Give them some quirks and some flaws, a main goal, and draft out a basic backstory for them. If you know who your character is it will be easier to talk as them instead of talking about them.
                Role-play largely happens using your Charisma based skills: Persuasion, Intimidation, Deception and Performance, as well as your Insight skill.
                Role-play does not need to happen only with NPCs. It can and should also happen within the party, perhaps to lie about a particular detail of your character’s mysterious backstory, or exactly how much gold you were rewarded for a particular deed. For both of these, you would need to make what is called a Contested Check. The person who is lying will roll a Deception check and the person being lied to will roll an Insight check. Whoever rolls higher wins; if the Deception check wins, the lie is believed, if not… well, you may have some inter-party conflict, leading to more interesting role-play scenarios.
