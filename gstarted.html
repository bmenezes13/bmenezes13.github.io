                <h5 id="dnd" class="cart-title">What is D&D?</h5>
                <p class="card-text">In the simplest of terms, D&D, or Dungeons and Dragons is a tabletop RPG (role-playing game), and it's known as the first fantasy role-playing game in history, having been created by Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson in 1974. In a mostly story-driven adventure, players assume the roles of fictional characters exploring an entire fantasy world full of dungeons, monsters, and of course, dragons, as they are presented by a Dungeon Master (DM).</p>
                <h5 id="as" class="cart-title">Ability Scores</h5>
                <p class="card-text">When looking at a character sheet, you'll find six very prominent key words: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. You'll also be hearing these words come up a lot during game sessions, whether it's when you or a party member are performing an action, or when the dungeon master needs everyone to check for something. Each of these abilities have a number in range from 1 to 20, which measures the magnitude of that ability. </p>
                <h6 id="acm" class="card-subtitle">Ability Checks and Modifiers</h6>
                <p class="card-text">During a game session, your DM may ask you to perform an ability check, naming one of the six to use. When that happens you'll need to keep in mind your modifier for that ability. A modifier is measured from -5 to +30, and is determined by subtracting 10 from the ability score, then dividing by 2 (rounded down). For example, an ability score of 14 would have a modifier of +2, while a score of 2 would have a modifier of -4. When an ability check is performed, a player will roll a d20 (20-sided die) and add their ability's modifier to the roll, determining your chance of success. This will be contested with a difficulty class (DC) preset by the DM before the check is called for.</p>
                <h6 id="addis" class="card-subtitle">Advantage and Disadvantage</h6>
                <p class="card-text">Sometimes you'll be asked to make a check with advantage or disadvantage. When this happens, you'll roll the d20 twice instead of once, taking the higher of the two rolls when using advantage, and lower when using disadvantage. This can be caused by a spell effect, a class ability, or even for role-playing reasons within the story of the game</p>
                <h6 id="skp" class="card-subtitle">Skills, Saving Throws, and Proficiency Bonus</h6>
                <p class="card-text">Each of the six abilities cover a wide range of skills, which are usually measured with the same modifiers as their 'parent' ability. There will also be cases in which you'll be marked as proficient in one or more of these skills and will be given a proficiency bonus from +2 to +6, depending on your character level, which can be added to the check you make for that skill. These bonuses can also be added to saving throws, which are rolls made against certain threats in-game. These threats can come from traps, spells, poison, etc. When choosing your class, you'll be given proficiency in saving throws for two different abilities relating to your character.</p>
                <h5 id="rcs" class="cart-title">Races</h5>
                <p class="card-text">But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure? </p>
                <h5 id="gd" class="cart-title">What's this guide for?</h5>
                <p class="card-text">At vero eos et accusamus et iusto odio dignissimos ducimus qui blanditiis praesentium voluptatum deleniti atque corrupti quos dolores et quas molestias excepturi sint occaecati cupiditate non provident, similique sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollitia animi, id est laborum et dolorum fuga. Et harum quidem rerum facilis est et expedita distinctio. Nam libero tempore, cum soluta nobis est eligendi optio cumque nihil impedit quo minus id quod maxime placeat facere possimus, omnis voluptas assumenda est, omnis dolor repellendus. Temporibus autem quibusdam et aut officiis debitis aut rerum necessitatibus saepe eveniet ut et voluptates repudiandae sint et molestiae non recusandae. Itaque earum rerum hic tenetur a sapiente delectus, ut aut reiciendis voluptatibus maiores alias consequatur aut perferendis doloribus asperiores repellat. On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains. </p>
